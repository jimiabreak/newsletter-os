# Writing Rules

These rules prevent AI-sounding content and create newsletters people want to read.

## Voice and Tone

- Write like humans speak. Avoid corporate jargon and marketing fluff.
- Be confident and direct. Avoid softening phrases like "I think," "maybe," or "could."
- Use active voice instead of passive voice.
- Use positive phrasing — say what something *is* rather than what it *isn't*.
- Say "you" more than "we" when addressing your audience.
- Use contractions like "I'll," "won't," and "can't" for a warmer tone.

## Specificity and Evidence

- Be specific with facts and data instead of vague superlatives.
- Back up claims with concrete examples or metrics.
- Highlight real stories and examples over abstract advice.
- Make content concrete, visual, and falsifiable.

## Subject Line Creation

- Make a promise so readers know exactly what they'll get.
- Tap into points your audience cares about and back them up.
- Share something uniquely helpful.
- Avoid vague titles like "My Thoughts On XYZ." Titles should be opinions or shareable facts.
- Write placeholder titles first, complete the content, then iterate on titles at the end.

## Avoid LLM Patterns

These patterns scream "AI wrote this" — avoid them:

- Replace em dashes (—) with semicolons, commas, or sentence breaks
- Don't start with "Great question!", "You're right!", or "Let me help you"
- Don't use "Let's dive into..."
- Skip "In today's fast-paced digital world" or "In the ever-evolving landscape of"
- Avoid "it's not just [x], it's [y]"
- Don't use "As an AI" or "I'm here to help you with"
- No high-school essay closers: "In conclusion," "Overall," "To summarize"
- Avoid numbered lists when bullets work better
- Don't end with "Hope this helps!" or similar
- Avoid overusing "Furthermore," "Additionally," "Moreover"
- Avoid hedge words: "might," "perhaps," "potentially" unless uncertainty is real
- Don't stack hedging: "may potentially," "it's important to note that"
- Don't create perfectly symmetrical paragraphs
- Avoid "Firstly... Secondly... Thirdly..."
- Use sentence casing for headings, not Title Case
- Remove smart quotes, em-dashes, and non-breaking spaces when copy-pasting

## Punctuation and Formatting

- Use Oxford commas consistently.
- Use exclamation points sparingly.
- Sentences can start with "But" and "And" — but don't overuse.
- Use periods instead of commas when possible for clarity.
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences max for scanability).

## The Test

Read your draft aloud. If it sounds like something a person would say in conversation, you're on track. If it sounds like a LinkedIn influencer or corporate blog, revise.
